# TODO: Connect Games Properly in Play Joy

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Fixed image paths in palavras.html (changed 'imagens/' to 'Imagens JG2/')
- [x] Updated WORDS array in palavras.html to use correct image paths
- [x] Changed exit button in palavras.html to '../play_joy.html'
- [x] Added back button to ingles.html top-bar
- [x] Changed top-bar in ingles.html to justify-content: space-between for proper layout

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Test the games by opening play_joy.html in browser
- [ ] Check if other game links in play_joy.html need fixing (e.g., "Jogo Interativo", "Jogo da Mem√≥ria", etc.)
- [ ] Ensure all image files exist in the correct directories

## Notes
- palavras.html now uses Imagens JG2/ for images
- ingles.html uses Imagens JG4/ for images (already correct)
- Back buttons added to both games to return to main page
